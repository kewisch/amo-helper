# AMO Helper

This add-on is meant to make ad-hoc improvements to the AMO review experience.
If features are useful for everyone, we might add them to AMO eventually.

If you are adding a new feature, please use separate directories/files similar
to how the existing features are written. As for versioning, please go ahead
and bump the version number in each changeset. Reminder:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
